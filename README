This is a very simple library which extends PyRSS2Gen to support generating GeoRSS feeds.  

See http://www.dalkescientific.com/Python/PyRSS2Gen.html

I wrote it to facilitate the creation of a map of New City's 100 Essential Chicago restaurants; I've used it on a couple of other things which aren't published.  So far it seems to work. Feel free to send pull requests if you make improvements.
